Description: Provides functions for the Bayesian analysis of extreme value
    models.  The 'rust' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rust> is
    used to simulate a random sample from the required posterior distribution.
    The functionality of 'revdbayes' is similar to the 'evdbayes' package
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=evdbayes>, which uses Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo ('MCMC') methods for posterior simulation.  In addition, there
    are functions for making inferences about the extremal index, using 
    the models for threshold inter-exceedance times of Suveges and Davison 
    (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOAS292> and Holesovsky and Fusek (2020) 
    <doi:10.1007/s10687-020-00374-3>. Also provided are d,p,q,r functions for 
    the Generalised Extreme Value ('GEV') and Generalised Pareto ('GP') 
    distributions that deal appropriately with cases where the shape parameter 
    is very close to zero.
